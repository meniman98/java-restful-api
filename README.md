# RESTful API using Spring
Hello and welcome. How nice of you to visit. Let's get down to business
Here you'll see a REST api developed with the right practises. Includes a POJO of a car. Using this api, you can create, read, update and delete cars. Beautiful.
The api has its own exception handling. Pretty cool.

I made this api back in March 2020 right before the storm. I made it for practise purposes and to showcase my skills as a developer
